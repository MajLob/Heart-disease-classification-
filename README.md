# Heart Disease Classification: Model Comparison
Random Forest Classifier, SVC, Decision Tree Clasifier, KNN

Analysis of dataset related to heart disease and comparing the effectiveness of the following classification models:
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Project Overview

The dataset includes medical and demographic features that may contribute to heart disease. 

The code includes:
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and statistical exploration to understand data distributions and relationships.
3. Data Visualizations: Charts and plots to illustrate important trends and findings.
4. Model Training & Comparison: Implementation and evaluation of multiple machine learning models to predict heart disease.
5. Model Evaluation Metrics: Comparison of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
